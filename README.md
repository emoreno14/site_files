## About
Hello! My name is Elva, I am an English graduate student at the University of Lincoln-Nebraska. As a new digital humanists, I will be comparing different resources and material that will be discussed in ENGL-477. Most importantly, I will be critically engaging with this material to talk about the impact of COVID-19 in my community. My album at Flickr is just one aspect of my reflection on COVID, you can also read my blog "Unprecedented Times with Elva" (emorenodelrio477.wordpress.com/) to continue learning about my project.
